    "description": "Welcome to AI and Machine Learning for Coders, a book that I’ve been wanting to write for many years but that has only really become possible due to recent advances in machine learning (ML) and, in particular, TensorFlow. The goal of this book is to prepare you, as a coder, for many of the scenarios that you can address with machine learning, with the aim of equipping you to be an ML and AI developer without needing a PhD! I hope that you’ll find it useful, and that it will empower you with the confidence to get started on this wonderful and rewarding journey.",
